    <h1>Keyword Mapping for the ICL Open Access Book Series</h1>
    <p>A global platform for advancing landslide research and applications.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>The Open Access book series by the International Consortium on Landslides (ICL) serves as a global platform for sharing advancements in landslide research and practical applications, contributing to the Kyoto Landslide Commitment 2020 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. It features diverse contributions, including research articles, case studies, activity reports, and educational tools, aimed at enhancing understanding and reducing landslide disaster risks.</p>
    <p>As of December 2024, the Open Access book series has published five volumes, featuring over 130 articles. These articles include approximately 500 distinct keywords. To provide an overview and assist in article searches, these keywords have been categorized into 14 groups, and a tree map has been created. The tree map allows users to view the keywords organized by category and access individual articles where specific keywords are used by navigating through the map. This tool enhances the usability of the series, enabling efficient exploration and a better understanding of the scope of the research.</p>

    <p>In addition to the keyword tree map, we provide a category network visualization. This network shows the relationships between keyword categories, enabling users to see how different research areas connect and overlap within the ICL Open Access book series. It is a powerful tool for identifying interdisciplinary themes and key focus areas in landslide research.</p>
